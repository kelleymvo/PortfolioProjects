Hi, I'm Kelley Vo!

Welcome to my personal project.

So far, I have explored COVID19 vaccination and death rates globally. 
You can find my data visualizations here https://public.tableau.com/profile/kelley.mahal.vo#!/vizhome/COVID19ExplorationDashboard/Dashboard1?publish=yes
and the datasets come from here: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths. 

My main takeaways from this project is SQL query development, analytical breakdown, and creating data visualizations.
I used Tableau, Microsoft SQL Server Studio, and Excel.

As I continue to find more data to explore, I will add more into my project!

Thank you so much for checking out my exploration!
